 This project presents an advanced Machine Learning classification system built using Python and scikit-learn to predict student performance (Pass/Fail) based on academic and behavioral features. The model uses key input variables such as study hours, attendance percentage, and previous exam scores to make predictions. The workflow includes data preparation, label encoding, train–test splitting, feature scaling, and model training using a Decision Tree Classifier implemented within a Pipeline for clean and efficient processing. To improve performance and avoid overfitting, hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV with cross-validation. The model is evaluated using industry-standard metrics including accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix, and also supports real-time user predictions through a custom prediction function. This project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in education analytics, student risk assessment, and decision-support systems, while highlighting advantages such as automated preprocessing, optimized model selection, modular design, and real-world ML deployment readiness. It serves as a strong portfolio project for roles in machine learning, data science, and AI engineering.
